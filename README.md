🐍 Python Learning Journey Welcome to my Python learning repository!
🚀 I am an MCA student, starting my Python journey from scratch and documenting everything I learn step by step.
This repository contains:
📘 Basic Programs – variables, operators, input/output 
🔁 Control Statements – if-else, loops, patterns 
🧩 Functions & OOP – functions, classes, inheritance 
⚠ Exception Handling – try-except, custom exceptions 
📂 Mini Projects – simple apps to practice concepts 
📊 Data Science Libraries (later) – NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib.

🌱 Learning Goals ✔ Build strong Python fundamentals ✔ Practice coding through small programs & mini-projects ✔ Move towards Data Science & Machine Learning in the future

🤝 Contributions This repo is part of my personal learning journey. Suggestions, tips, and project ideas are always welcome!
